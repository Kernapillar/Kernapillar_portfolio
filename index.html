									<h2>About Me</h2>
								</header>
								<div>
									My name is Alex Kern and I am a fullstack engineer with experience in Javascript, React, Redux, Ruby on Rails, and Python. In my recent projects i have also utilized PostgreSQL, CSS3, HTML5 and AWS for file storage. Before entering the coding world, I earned a B.A. of Psychology from UC Santa Cruz in 2018, and spent some time working at a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center, as well as a few years as an apartment leasing specialist in the Bay Area. While leasing, I met quite a few software discovered a passion for computer programming after deciding to take a Python course at my local community college. After a few classes I decided to make the jump to enroll in App Academy, learning coding and web development full time.
									<br>
									<br>
During my time at App Academy, I was able to incorporate my interest in music into my projects, most notably in my javascript project, 4 Block Loop. This project utilized the Tone.js library as a stepping stone to incorporate synthesizer and audio playing functionality. I used vanilla javascript to create multiple sequencers (utilizing my new knowledge and understanding of object oriented programming and inheritance) as well as a piano playable using the computer keyboard.
<br>
<br>
In more recent projects, I worked primarily with React and Redux alongside Ruby on Rails to build out a full stack spotify clone, as well as a MERN stack group project about drawing and artistic collaboration, regardless of artistic ability. Both of these full stack projects are currently hosted on Heroku, available for everyone to check out.
<br>
<br>
I look forward to building more creative and interesting projects in the coming years, and hope to meet and work with some great people along the way!
